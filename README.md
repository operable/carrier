# Carrier

A lightweight messaging and message validation library for MQTT.

## Getting carrier

Add `carrier` to the `deps` section of `mix.exs`:

`{:carrier, github: "operable/carrier}`

## Using carrier

Until we have time to write proper docs the moduledocs for `Carrier.Messaging.Connection` and `Carrier.CredentialStore` are good places to start.

## Filing issues

Carrier issues are tracked centrally in [Cog's](https://github.com/operable/cog/issues) issue tracker.
